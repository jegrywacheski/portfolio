					<h2 class="major">About</h2>
					<p>
						As a passionate software developer, my journey into the
						world of programming began in high school computer
						science courses, where I first dipped my toes into the
						intricate world of code. It didn't take long for me to
						realize that I loved programming and the endless
						possibilities it offered.
					</p>

					<p>
						My academic journey saw me embark on a quest for
						knowledge, starting at the University of Waterloo. After
						a year of exploration, I transferred to the University
						of Alberta, where I diligently pursued my passion. In
						June 2023, I proudly earned my Bachelor's degree in
						Computer Science.
					</p>

					<p>
						I am currently the CTO and part owner of DentHire, a
						startup based in Edmonton, Alberta. I joined the team in
						November 2023 as a Junior Software Developer and quickly
						moved into leadership after demonstrating my skills,
						ownership mindset, and ability to deliver results. Over
						the past two years, I've led the full-stack development
						of DentHire's core web application, which connects
						dental professionals with dental offices. This has
						included everything from designing and implementing new
						features, integrating third-party services, and
						optimizing performance, to collaborating closely with
						the founders on product strategy and user experience.
					</p>

					<p>
						DentHire is now transitioning from a development-heavy
						phase into platform maintenance and a go-to-market
						strategy. While I remain connected to the company in a
						leadership capacity, I am seeking new opportunities
						where I can continue to grow my technical skills, work
						on diverse projects, and contribute to building
						innovative products from the ground up.
					</p>

					<p>
						My expertise spans a wide range of technologies and
						programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C,
						Java, as well as a deep understanding of database
						technologies such as MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and
						SQLite. I thrive on the challenges of creating servers
						and APIs, seamlessly integrating third-party services,
						and developing web applications using HTML, CSS, PHP,
						TypeScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, React,
						Node.js, Next.js, Deno, and Django.
					</p>

					<p>
						In the mobile realm, I'm well-versed in crafting
						applications using Java and Android Studio, React
						Native, and Flutter. Quality assurance is paramount in
						my work, and I have a comprehensive understanding of
						various testing methodologies to ensure robust,
						error-free applications. I also appreciate the
						significance of a user-friendly interface, with a strong
						background in UI design principles and practices.
					</p>

					<p>
						My development process adheres to Agile methodologies,
						with a proficiency in Scrum and sprint planning. I excel
						in documenting the application development journey
						through diagrams and reports, ensuring clear
						communication and organized progress.
					</p>

					<p>
						One of my key strengths lies in my ability to quickly
						adapt to new languages and frameworks independently,
						reflecting my unquenchable thirst for knowledge and
						growth.
					</p>

					<p>
						I'm thrilled to share my journey, experiences, and
						projects with you as I continue to evolve as a software
						developer. Feel free to explore my
						<a href="#work">portfolio</a> to witness my passion and
						dedication in action.

						<h3>Travel Like a Local</h3>
						<p>
							Inspired by my love for travel and exploration, I
							embarked on a personal project to create the
							ultimate travel companion app. The purpose of this
							app is to help users discover lesser-known local
							experiences, hidden gems, and last-minute activities
							- recommended by fellow travelers or locals.
						</p>
						<p>
							This project is in development, but you can view the
							code repository on GitHub

						<h3>Simple Chat App</h3>
						<p>
							To further my understanding of websockets and
							real-time communication, I embarked on a personal
							project to create a simple chat application.
						</p>
						<span class="image main"><img
								src="images/chatapp-login.png"
								alt=""
							/></span>
						<p>
							This project allowed me to enhance my backend skills
							by developing a Node.js server that utilized the
							Socket.io library to facilitate real-time
							communication between clients. I used the Passport
							authentication middleware to implement user
							authentication, ensuring that only registered users
							could access the chat application. I also integrated
							express-session to manage user sessions.
						</p>
						<span class="image main"><img
								src="images/chatapp-register.png"
								alt=""
							/></span>
						<p>
							To continue practicing my JavaScript and CSS skills,
							I decided on a frontend that uses simple HTML, CSS,
							and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface.
							I also use the ejs templating engine to dynamically
							render user data on the client side.

						<h3>My Running Board</h3>
						<p>
							As a freelance fullstack developer, I collaborated
							closely with a client to elevate the functionality
							of their existing website. Their specific
							requirement centered around enhancing the
							interactivity of the map page. To achieve this, I
							harnessed the power of the Google Maps API, enabling
							users to drag and customize their routes, and
							providing the seamless option to open routes in
							Google Maps navigation.
						</p>
						<span class="image main"><img
								src="images/myrunningboard-undo_code.png"
								alt=""
							/></span>
						<p>
							In this project, I expanded my skill set by
							mastering PHP, skillfully combining it with my prior
							expertise in JavaScript and HTML to create a highly
							interactive map experience. One of the project's
							most demanding aspects was the implementation of an
							undo feature, a feature not natively supported by
							Google Maps. To address this challenge, I devised a
							sophisticated solution by utilizing a stack to track
							and store changes made to waypoints before
							committing them to the database. This not only
							ensured the seamless functionality of the map page
							but also provided users with a crucial ability to
							amend and revert their route adjustments.

						<h3>Daycare Management</h3>
						<p>
							During my last semester of university, I had the
							opportunity to collaborate with a diverse team of
							student developers on a multifaceted mobile and web
							application project.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this endeavor, I assumed the pivotal role of
							Scrum Master, guiding our team through each sprint
							with precision and dedication. Our primary mission
							was to collaborate with an external client,
							transforming their visionary concept into a tangible
							working prototype. This journey took us through the
							entire software development process, encompassing
							the inception of user stories, the creation of
							comprehensive diagrams, the meticulous design of
							code architecture, and the ultimate deployment of
							the application, facilitated by a robust continuous
							integration pipeline. You can view a demo of our
							application
							<a
								href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K7LWYVXljg"
							>here</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to my Scrum Master responsibilities, I
							actively contributed to the application's
							development by spearheading various features and
							functions. My focus was primarily on the frontend,
							where I undertook the development of the activity
							feed and the integrated camera. Furthermore, I
							skillfully programmed the integration of numerous
							endpoints into the frontend, ensuring seamless data
							flow from the presentation layer through the
							business layer, all the way to the database. This
							collaborative effort contributed significantly to
							the application's overall functionality and user
							experience.
						</p>
						<div style="display: inline-block">
							<span class="image left" style><img
									src="images/daycaremgmt-workerfeed.jpg"
									alt=""
								/></span>
							<span class="image left"><img
									src="images/daycaremgmt-parentfeed.jpg"
									alt=""
								/></span>
						</div>
						<p>
							I engaged with a wide spectrum of cutting-edge
							technologies throughout the project, each carefully
							chosen to address specific aspects of our
							development needs. Our mobile frontend was expertly
							crafted using Flutter, a robust and versatile
							framework. On the server side, we harnessed the
							power of Django, complemented by an administration
							webpage and a PostgreSQL database to manage and
							organize our application's core functionality.
							Deployment was made efficient and scalable thanks to
							Docker and the Cybera platform.
						</p>
						<p>
							To ensure seamless collaboration and efficient
							project management, we relied on the dynamic
							capabilities of GitHub. This encompassed
							comprehensive code base management, issue tracking
							and assignment, the organization of our storyboard,
							and the facilitation of rigorous code reviews. Our
							use of these technologies not only streamlined our
							development process but also paved the way for a
							highly functional and cohesive final product. You
							can view our full design and project management
