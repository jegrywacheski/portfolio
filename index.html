								<p>
									My expertise spans a wide range of technologies and programming languages, 
									including Python, JavaScript, C, Java, as well as a deep understanding of 
									database technologies such as MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. 
									I thrive on the challenges of creating servers and APIs, seamlessly 
									integrating third-party services, and developing web applications using 
									HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, React, Node,
									Next, Deno, and Django.
								</p>

									<h3>Simple Chat App</h3>
									<p>
										To further my understanding of websockets and real-time communication,
										I embarked on a personal project to create a simple chat application.
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/chatapp-login.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										This project allowed me to enhance my backend skills by developing a
										Node.js server that utilized the Socket.io library to facilitate
										real-time communication between clients. I used the Passport
										authentication middleware to implement user authentication, ensuring
										that only registered users could access the chat application.
										I also integrated express-session to manage user sessions. 
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/chatapp-register.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										To continue practicing my JavaScript and CSS skills, I decided on a
										frontend that uses simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly 
										interface. I also use the ejs templating engine to dynamically render user
										data on the client side.

									<h3>My Running Board</h3>
									<p>
										As a freelance fullstack developer, I collaborated closely with a client to elevate the 
										functionality of their existing website. Their specific requirement centered 
										around enhancing the interactivity of the map page. To achieve this, I harnessed
										the power of the Google Maps API, enabling users to drag and customize their routes, 
										and providing the seamless option to open routes in Google Maps navigation.
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/myrunningboard-undo_code.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										In this project, I expanded my skill set by mastering PHP, skillfully combining 
										it with my prior expertise in JavaScript and HTML to create a highly interactive 
										map experience. One of the project's most demanding aspects was the implementation 
										of an undo feature, a feature not natively supported by Google Maps. To address 
										this challenge, I devised a sophisticated solution by utilizing a stack to track 
										and store changes made to waypoints before committing them to the database. This 
										not only ensured the seamless functionality of the map page but also provided users
										with a crucial ability to amend and revert their route adjustments.

									<h3>Daycare Management</h3>
									<p>I had the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse team of student developers 
										on a multifaceted mobile and web application project. In this endeavor, I assumed
										the pivotal role of Scrum Master, guiding our team through each sprint with 
										precision and dedication. Our primary mission was to collaborate with an external 
										client, transforming their visionary concept into a tangible working prototype. 
										This journey took us through the entire software development process, encompassing 
										the inception of user stories, the creation of comprehensive diagrams, the 
										meticulous design of code architecture, and the ultimate deployment of the 
										application, facilitated by a robust continuous integration pipeline. You
										can view a demo of our application 
										<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K7LWYVXljg">here</a>.
									</p>
									<p>
										In addition to my Scrum Master responsibilities, I actively contributed to 
										the application's development by spearheading various features and functions.
										My focus was primarily on the frontend, where I undertook the development of 
										the activity feed and the integrated camera. Furthermore, I skillfully 
										programmed the integration of numerous endpoints into the frontend, ensuring 
										seamless data flow from the presentation layer through the business layer, 
										all the way to the database. This collaborative effort contributed significantly 
										to the application's overall functionality and user experience.
									</p>
									<div style="display: inline-block;">
										<span class="image left" style><img src="images/daycaremgmt-workerfeed.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<span class="image left"><img src="images/daycaremgmt-parentfeed.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									</div>
									<p>
										I engaged with a wide spectrum of cutting-edge technologies throughout the 
										project, each carefully chosen to address specific aspects of our development 
										needs. Our mobile frontend was expertly crafted using Flutter, a robust and 
										versatile framework. On the server side, we harnessed the power of Django, 
										complemented by an administration webpage and a PostgreSQL database to manage
										and organize our application's core functionality. Deployment was made 
										efficient and scalable thanks to Docker and the Cybera platform.
									</p>
									<p>
										To ensure seamless collaboration and efficient project management, we relied 
										on the dynamic capabilities of GitHub. This encompassed comprehensive code 
										base management, issue tracking and assignment, the organization of our 
										storyboard, and the facilitation of rigorous code reviews. Our use of these 
										technologies not only streamlined our development process but also paved the 
										way for a highly functional and cohesive final product. You can view our full
										design and project management documents
